<div id="title">Life Path Number</div>
<div id="content">The <i>Life Path Number</i> is the sum of the birth date i.e. DD+MM+YY.<br><br>Your Life Path which is the reduced sum of your date of birth, gives an important indication on the type of events that you will be regularly confronted with, throughout your life. It isn't possible to skip school, the events always catch up with you, that's why in general one naturally adopts a style compatible with one's Life Path rather than going against the current. Numerology allows you to understand the nature of your route and the events likely to stimulate you. This will allow you the power to adopt the attitude that permits you to sail serenely on the sea of your life without capsizing or getting shaken about. A well-informed man is worth two.</div>
<div id="title" style="margin-top:20px">Personal Year Number</div>
<div id="content">The Personal Year Number is the reduced sum of :<br><br>
Day of Birth + Month of Birth + Current Year<br><br>
The Personal Year Number constitutes one of the major vibrations that you will be confronted with during the course of your life. Numerology calculates your Personal Year Number by adding (vertically) your date and month of birth to the current year. In reducing this number we will end up with a figure between 1 and 9. Each year is thus individualized and it is interesting to know this basic element in order to understand the dominant vibration which will always accompany you during this period and in order to help you to chose the best course of action. It is necessary, nevertheless, to keep in mind that dominant vibration does not signify fate or destiny. The explanation of a Personal Year Number is only concerned with the trends that you are going to experience and it gives an indication of how you are likely to react faced with these influences. Free-will is not denied, but the simple fact is, our decision making can be more judicious when we have got a bit of information beforehand.

<div id="content">
<i>Pythagorean square</i> or <i>"Psychomatrix"</i> gives a characteristic according to the date of birth. It was developed by Pythagoras in the 5th century BC and was developed by his followers. The basic idea of psychomatrix is that the date of birth has a certain combination of numbers, with the help of which the human psychological type can be described. Each number from 1 to 9 symbolizes a certain quality and depending on the frequency of repetitions strengthens them.

It's value is the reduced sum of the vowels of the full name (given at birth).<br><br>
The Desire Number corresponds to your deep motivations, to that which is important to you. It influences you in your choices and decisions even if you are not always conscious of it. This number is related to your tastes, psychological options or deep emotions. Your Expression Number will be strongly tinted or shaded by your Desire Number. This vibration is calculated by reducing the sum of the vowels of your full name given at birth.</div>
<div id="title" style="margin-top:20px">Intimate Number</div>
<div id="content">
It's the reduced sum of all the consonants of the full name.<br><br>
The Intimate Number, also known as the "the hidden self", is the unconscious base of your personality. It forms a little of the "keep" or the main tower of your castle. Through it you search for strength when you feel the need ; particularly in conflicting situations, each time you must confront an important problem or undertaking, when you are tense, tired or when your primordial interests are threatened. At such a time you will stop using the vibration of your Expression Number in order to lean exclusively on your Intimate Number. It is your way of reacting. The Intimate Number's vibration allows one to know the hidden character of the human being, to reveal is behavior, strategy and reactions in cases of problem, tension, stress.</div>
